# Laser Defender
This is a game modeled after the classic laser defender. The premise is that you are a spaceship and you are to kill as many of the enmey
spaceships as possible before you die. I followed a tutorial for this one, but they stopped after there was a simple game up and running.
I decided to take it further and added flying asteroids, powerups, shields, bonus alien spaceships, and the spaceships would get 
progressively more difficult as the game goes on. It was real fun to make and I hope youe enjoy playing or learning from it.
